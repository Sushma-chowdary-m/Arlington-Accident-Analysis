# Arlington-Accident-Analysis
This project investigates the relationship between traffic patterns and accident occurrences at intersections in the vicinity of the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) and Arlington, Texas.

Data Collection:

The data for this project was meticulously collected by manually visiting various intersections at different times of the day. This approach was chosen to capture the variability in traffic patterns across different locations and times.

Data Analysis:

The project focuses on calculating descriptive statistics for both continuous and grouping variables. The key continuous variable of interest is the number of vehicles passing through an intersection. The grouping variables include:

Time of Day
Intersection Type
Number of Lanes
These variables are used to explore their potential influence on the number of accidents occurring at each intersection within a specific timeframe.

Inter-arrival Times for Pedestrians (Dataset 2):

A separate analysis was conducted on a second dataset focusing on pedestrian traffic. This dataset included variables such as start time and end time for each pedestrian crossing an intersection at any given minute. The objective here was to calculate the inter-arrival times between pedestrians.

Data Cleaning and Exploration:

Both datasets were carefully cleaned to identify and address any outliers or missing values. Descriptive statistics were then calculated to summarize the collected data. Additionally, histograms were generated to visualize the distribution of the data and determine if it follows a normal or exponential pattern.
